# Meet up
As you choose to catalog first the insects and creatures, You choose to go to catalog in a quieter place while you think of something to solve your situation

As Oliver is being amazed by the critters he finds, He is assaulted by giant melissi bees that apprehend him, unbeknownst to him he was trespassing on ruins closed to the general public. The Melissi guards spoke in a language he didn't understand but they were talking about him being a human

Him and his ship were taken to their colony in Thornbush and one of the guards told him in English "You sure are lucky" Oliver confused was taken to Zinnia's colony and to be seen by her. As she saw Oliver she in perfect English mentioned how she couldn't believe they found a Human.

Zinnia was eager to study the stranded human in an effort to document and put forth some contribution for the Melissi Libraries as a show off to her mother and sisters to get her closer to the throne, and thus Oliver would be given a room and everyday would talk to Zinnia about any topic Human related for her to write and document about in exchange of maybe helping him with his stranded problem

~~he stumbles upon Zinnia a Melissi who unbeknownst to him was one of the 4 Princesses. Both see each other with surprise Zinnia is more interested in the fact she hasn't seen a Human up close before and the same goes for Oliver who hadn't ever seen a Melissi so up close~~

~~After some Dialogue with Zinnia Oliver expresses the need for help with his ship but Zinnia replies that he is most likely stranded as she looks at him from different angles and expresses that she can give him a place to stay... in exchange for helping her study human~~

# Struggle

As she learned in her studies of the hardships the kingdom went through and how their mother was able to uplift the kingdom into their golden era, Zinnia saw from a young age how her sisters in her mind just weren't going to be capable of being worthy successors for their mother

One completely uninterested in the role, Poppy
One a complete airhead, Lilly
And the other one a self absorbed ego, Freesia

And from an early age she felt she had a duty to live up to her mother, day in an out studying and putting on herself expectations to meet to be able to be the best queen for her people.

She began to develop bitterness towards her sisters for their carelessness of their duty they were born with. and developed an obsession with excellency

This obsession to be the best queen has led her to be unable to develop any kind of healthy relationships, all she thinks of is work and efficiency. not tolerating any mistake or fault on her colony. This attitude and path she chose to become the best has made her incredibly cold and distant to others, making some even fear her

Deep down she sees how those in her colony are afraid of her even if her intentions for excellency are well placed, This fuels her distress and self doubt which fuels her obsession in a unhealthy cycle

When trying to sleep after a day of work she ponders "What could have been"

# Conflict

She liked history as a child, but when she began to read and see the past of her land, she realized that if any time another tragedy happens like the earthquake it would be up to the queen at the time to live up to her mother's efforts and achievements to lift the kingdom once again just like she did

and if the queen at the time were to be one of her sisters she thought it would spell doom to all... But if she were to do her best to live up to and surpass her mother she would be able to secure the safety of her people

She felt the need but not the desire, and thus she sacrificed all that didn't further the goal of becoming the best queen she could

including her happiness, making her a cold bitter obsessive and determined successor, incapable of making her own people happy or those directly in front of her

Like the one that was present the most around her the one who raised her, Prickly, She told her off showing the effects her self imposed pressure of being the queen was having on her. She lashed out at her showing concern and suggesting she left the race to become queen, as seeing her so miserable hurt Prickly's heart

# Resolution

Zinnia could show or allude to her inner conflict or desire to be as carefree as her sisters by Oliver accompanying her in one of her trips to study the ancient landscape of her colony like finding by accident huge abandoned structures

But because her alarm starts to sound indicating time to go back

A choice could happen to 
insist to check it out
or
Turn back

If option 1 then she would after the fact thank Oliver for insisting as she wouldn't have allowed herself to do so otherwise, which Segway's on to her desire to be a scholar/historian, "If things were different" as she has a duty to fulfill and become the queen

Oliver then would question the why's and Zinnia would spill the beans on how she feels bitter about her sisters, and that its up to her to live up to their mother and she **has** to do it

But Oliver would retort that she has a right to be happy as well

Zinnia
Im happy

Oliver
Sure, its not like you look miserable

Zinnia
...It is what it is

Oliver
You think that an unhappy, bitter, and cold queen is what your people will need in a time of necessity? 

Zinnia
I... I guess your right... Maybe I'm not what my people deserve. They hate and fear me after all

Oliver
If you showed them that side you've showed me today, they'll stop doing so
Stop obsessing over work, lay back a little and... Enjoy life

Zinnia grabs his hand and...

Zinnia
Only if you stay... by my side

Thus Zinnia
