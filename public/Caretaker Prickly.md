# Meet up
After arriving to the castle independent of the route you chose, you'll be greeted by prickly and prompted to assist her with the chores she does in the castle (this starts her route)

Something as easy as Oliver wanting to assist her with cleaning the room he's staying in as a courtesy 

Some dialogue that alludes to her ==conflict==, maybe something as prickly mentioning how she has been taking care of the princesses since their birth, Oliver mentioning that's really wholesome ==like a second mother==, but prickly stopping for a mere moment to think with a sad demeanor but then returning to her usual stoic face

replying that "Yes, I guess so"

# Struggle

Prickly is from the worker class this caste doesnt reach sexual maturity and thus cant bear children of their own, when prickly retired from being a warrior and began helping her friend the queen to raise her daughters, something clicked inside of her, While on the field as an experienced bodyguard the few times her life was threatened on the field. 

All she could think of was what she wanted to return to, but as a Worker she couldn't bear a family of her own. When her work as a bodyguard ended she was surprised by the proposition of the queen, who she was close friends with, asked her to help her raise her daughters to be princesses

at first she thought not much of it, she was just going to be a nanny. But when she held the small defenseless Zinnia in her arms, something clicked inside her soul

She used to be so stoic but an indescribable happiness began to propagate itself inside her chest, from defenseless babies she aided to raise those princesses filling a void she didn't know she had in her soul

from their ups and downs she was there to advice, offer consolation and support. she felt as if they were her children
# Conflict
When Zinnia was beginning to feel the self imposed pressure of needing to become the successor to her mother, Prickly was there to console her but the more Zinnia exposed distress at **needing** to be the best successor not **wanting**, Prickly slowly began to break her stoic demeanor from offering consolation to outright asking Zinnia to stop pursuing if it was getting to her

That from what Zinnia was saying it felt like an self imposed pain that she should seek what she wanted to do, that she didn't want to see her feeling such self imposed pain

from that slip of the tongue, Zinnia struck right through her soul. "You are not my mother" & "Know your place" she said with a venomous tongue "What do you know about anything?" Zinnia lashed out at Prickly breaking the 20 year illusion she had, as if her world came crashing down from beneath her feet

Prickly just took her lashing out with a smile, a bow, an apology and she left without saying much, from this moment on she closed her heart and regained the stoic demeanor she always has with the excuse of "I'm just **tired**"
# Resolution

After Oliver discovers all these details by engaging in dialogue at how much Prickly knows about the princesses. from their favorite colors, foods, hobbies, studies he realizes she's not just a regular nanny but she cares about them and takes into account all she knows about them to satisfy their needs as best as possible

Maybe by engaging in dialogue about how she used to be a bodyguard
Maybe by going to a market and talking about how she almost died in a fight against a threat to the queen near the townsquare

it can be a segway to Oliver asking about why she became a bodyguard to her talking about how she met the queen to how the queen asked her to help raise her children

To a slip of the tongue from prickly where she reminisces about how cute zinnia and the others were as children with a smile. to quickly going back to her stoic demeanor

Oliver noticing and asking whats wrong

After a heart to heart with Prickly she opens up for the first time about how she feels. about how she cant bear children and felt attached to the princesses after raising them for 20 years, to Oliver asking what went wrong

> [!Prickly's Resolution]
> To Oliver telling her that what Zinnia told her after all she did for her and her sisters was wrong and that even if they didn't share a bloodline, what is family but those you grow to trust and love with your life? People you are willing to die for, people you are happy to see grow
> 
> Those you share emotions with, when they are sad you are too, when they succeed you feel Joy
> Prickly was in all sense of the word family to the princesses, no matter what Zinnia said when lashing out

Resulting in Oliver barging in and interrupting Zinnia's studies to her confusion

Zinnia "What the hell are you doing here?"
Oliver "I had a question"
Zinnia  "Huh?! Leave inmediatly before I rip your head off"
Oliver "Is that how you hope to become a queen?!"
Zinnia "...What did you say scum?"
Oliver "You cant even look out for those right beside you..."
Zinnia "Where is this coming from?!"

Oliver 
"You should know your place" 
Those were the words you said to the second one closest to you. and you didnt even care
Apologize...

Zinnia
Leave now...

Oliver
How could you say something like that and not care at all... what is wrong with you

Zinnia
You...

Prickly
Oliver you have to leave...

Oliver
But...

Zinnia
Leave now!!!!

As prickly tries to pull back Oliver from the confrontation gently, Oliver resists and keeps speaking

Oliver
She nursed you, Fed you, Looked after you, Consoled you, Teached you
If she had too cut herself to feed you her blood she would have...

Zinnia
Shutup!!!

Oliver
How can you ever hope to be a queen like your mother... If you cant even look out for those right beside you!!!!

Prickly
Oliver!!!

Zinnia looking down knew exactly what Oliver was talking about, and shut the door closed

Oliver is then given the goodbye to leave the castle for a while at least, when it all has calmed down

He apologizes in tears for the commotion and leaves

From Prickly's POV, she goes back to Zinnia's room trying to act oblivious

Prickly
My oh my, what could have gotten into him?

Zinnia
...

Prickly
Well im gonna clean this mess so you can keep studying

Zinnia puts her pen down and says in tears

Zinnia
Im sorry

Prickly
...no need to apologize Miss im sure he understands your anger

Zinnia
Prickly... I'm sorry

Prickly
...I dont know what your talking about

She refused to open her heart
Zinnia would stand from her chair showing her face riddled with tears

Zinnia
forgive me... I'm sorry... all this time

Prickly was left not knowing how to react as she saw zinnia on her knees aproaching her and wiping her tears with her clothes

Zinnia
I've never known how to apologize... Im sorry prickly
All this time I thought you hated me after what I said

Prickly
You idiot... I would never hate you...

As both cry and release their bottled up emotions both of them resolve their inner conflict
